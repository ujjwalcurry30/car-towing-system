This project proposes a system for towing a car using an ultrasonic sensor and NodeMCU microcontroller. The system utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between the towing vehicle and the car being towed. The NodeMCU, equipped with Wi-Fi capabilities, processes the distance data and sends commands to control the towing mechanism. The implementation involves setting up the hardware components, including the ultrasonic sensor and motor driver, and writing code to read sensor data, control the towing mechanism, and optionally communicate over Wi-Fi for remote monitoring and control. Safety considerations, such as implementing emergency stop functionality and ensuring reliable operation, are emphasized throughout the development process. The proposed system aims to provide a reliable and efficient solution for towing vehicles while considering safety aspects.
